# Loisp

Low Level Lisp (Loisp) is an S-expression based programming language implemented in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org).

## Quick Start

For now, programs written in this language are hardcoded in [main.rs](./src/main.rs). Running the compiler like this, should convert the source code into assembly.

```console
$ cargo run
```
